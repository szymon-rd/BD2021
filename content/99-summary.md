# Summary
In this project we implemented a basic commenting platform based on a massive dataset imported from reddit. It provided basic features like commenting and viewing top comments and subcomments, but most importantly - we provided a couple of complex searching features. We believe that it would be much harder, or even next to impossible, to provide them just with the PostgreSQL database. By using ElasticSearch, we implemented these features in a simple and efficient way.
